Next task Implementation Prompt
Please check the tasks.json file to find the last task implemented. Please continue with the next task. Please, work task by task. Wait until I ask you to implement another task. 
Let's go for the next non implemented task. Write the test code for the next task not implemented yet and, once done that, write the code of that task making sure it passes the test you wrote before. 
Run the tests, analyse the errors and fix them. Write the following log files, making sure the files are named starting with T (capital T) and the subtask number in a three figures number (e.g. T002.1 for subtask 2.1):

Implementation subtask log file and save it in the /log_files folder under the name TXXX.X_"name of the subtask"_Log
Test_log file and write it in the /log_tests folder under the name TXXX.X_"name of the task"_TestLog
Log_learn file or didactic log file explaining what has been developed in the project, why and how. Save it in the /log_learn folder under the name of TXXX.X_"name of the task"_Guide
Important Reminders
Don't forget to update the tasks.json file crossing the task you just completed once you're done with the tests, completed the log file and the learn file. Please add as well the implementation details.
Don't forget to use Tailwind for all the CSS related code.
